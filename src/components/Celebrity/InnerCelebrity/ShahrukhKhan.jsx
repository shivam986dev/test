                    <p>
                        According to reports, plans include for two additional floors, a glass-walled wing, and stronger security. Even the front gate has a new, rustic nameplate, which has already become a selfie magnet among enthusiasts.

                    <p>While hammers ring out on site, the Khan family has relocated to a rented Pali Hill duplex that costs around Rs 24 lakh per month, giving builders free rein. Work began in May 2025 and may continue throughout 2026, weather permitting.</p>
                    <p>Contractors believe significant structural construction will last until 2025, following which interiors will be styled. Until the wraps come off, throngs continue to congregate outside, anxious to see the latest chapter in Bollywood’s most famous address.</p>
                    <h3>Summing Up: Shahrukh Khan House</h3>
                    <p>Earlier this month, on Eid, Shahrukh greeted all of his admirers from outside his Mannat balcony. A long-standing tradition for the Khan on his birthday and Eid. However, due to the Covid epidemic, Shahrukh has not made an appearance in the last two years. So it was a momentous event for his followers, who finally saw their favourite star after two years: this Eid. And, of course, the nameplate was a visual delight for everyone. All photographs are credited to the social media handles of Shahrukh Khan and Gauri Khan.</p>
