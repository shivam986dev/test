                            <p>Geometric motifs and decorations are extensively used throughout the house and its exterior, most likely due to Virat’s great preference for shapes and numbers. The interiors of the property are quite breathtaking, with a great blend of modern vibes and touches of ethereal glamour throughout.</p>
                            <p>Virat Kohli’s house in Delhi was his first home. Virat Kohli, the captain of the Indian cricket team, spent most of his formative years in the Uttam Nagar region in western Delhi. He grew up in this location, which is where his interest in the sport began. This basic dwelling is a far cry from his current residence. Nonetheless, this house reflects his initial preference for sophisticated and visually beautiful architectural aspects. Virat Kohli’s previous residence was in Paschim Vihar, Meera Bagh, before he and his family relocated to a luxury villa in Gurugram, Haryana.</p>

                        <h3>Why We Love Virat Kohli’s House</h3>
                        <p>It’s an impressive structure</p>
                        <p>Kohli and his family relocated from the hustle and bustle of the streets near Meera Bagh to this stunning property in DLF Phase 1, Gurugram. Virat Kohli’s Gurgaon home is a magnificent architectural effort that has been published in various magazines.</p>
                        <p>When you first glance at the house, it looks like a collection of boxes stacked on top of one another. But then, when you look closely and pay attention, you discover that this gorgeous mansion is actually a 3D abstraction of an interlocking geometric structure, and we all know how much the homeowner enjoys geometry and geometric patterns. There is conjecture that the Indian cricketer paid Rs.80 crore for this magnificent mansion.</p>
                        <p>The Indian captain has kept the drawing room in his home quite modest. The dark-coloured wall, which makes a good pallet, serves as the room’s foundation; it is appropriate since it balances off the wooden furniture that graces the space. It also helps to highlight the big lamp, which serves as both art decor and a utilitarian piece in the area.</p>
                        <p>Virat Kohli’s mansion is believed to cost Rs.80 crore, and we believe it is well worth the money. The space has a glass wall that overlooks the alley, making it visually appealing and impressive. A lovely round candle holder has also been placed in the room, which has sparked a lot of interest when it originally appeared on Anushka Sharma’s Instagram story.</p>
                        <p>This gorgeous residence, which spans 500 square yards, has elements that have been meticulously constructed to make every aspect of Virat Kohli’s house open and accessible, ensuring that good feelings and energy flow through. The meticulous distribution of light also looks to be purposefully meant to avoid excessive glare while illuminating routes.</p>
                        <h3>Fun Living Room</h3>
                        <p>When Virat moved into the Bungalow in Gurugram in 2015, Kohli hosted a special celebration for his Indian cricket teammates. Some of the biggest names in sports, music, and entertainment attended this event.</p>
                        <p>Some of the Indian cricket team’s players, who are big lovers of console games and play them online, are claimed to be impressed by Virat’s arcade station in his living room. It does, however, provide ample chairs and a giant TV to satisfy their gaming needs, as well as a fully equipped playing console. Set beneath the stunning roof pattern design and with the ideal vertical gardening lining the area, the gaming experience in this space is truly amazing.</p>
                        <h3>Virat’s Unique Hanging Pool</h3>
                        <div className="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                            <img class="show-on-mobile img-fluid" src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/swimming-pool.png " alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>This dwelling boasts some of the best characteristics for its low price. Virat Kohli’s Gurugram residence is an excellent example of a modern mansion in the twenty-first century. It goes without saying that everything, and by everything, we mean that every single piece in this house is magnificent and contributes to the opulent and elegant vibes of the space. If the lovely interiors, exquisite floors, and well designed structure haven’t already piqued your interest, consider this: there is a unique hanging block buried within this property. This serves as a hidden pool within Virat Kohli’s home and always surprises new visitors.</p>
                        <p>A tile path leads to a rustic-looking wooden staircase just across the expansive garden, which Anoushka describes as her favourite element of the house on Instagram. Climb these stairs to reach the hanging pool. A treehouse with a pool appears to be every boy’s dream come true. The only difference is that the hanging pool is as elegant and spectacular as the rest of the house.</p>
                        <p>Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma have a daughter named Vamika Kohli. She was born on January 11, 2021. The couple has made an effort to keep their daughters off of social media. Their Instagram has gradually changed from a single couple to doting parents, and so has their home’s décor.</p>
                        <h3>Virat Kohli’s Mumbai House</h3>
                        <p>Virat Kohli’s residence in Mumbai is as spectacular as his bungalow in Gurugram.</p>
                        <p>Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma’s Mumbai home has been named one of the city’s swankiest celebrity pads. Anushka Sharma and her cricketer husband, Virat Kohli, have kept their admirers wondering about the interiors of their luxurious Mumbai home. Every time they share a glimpse into their lives during the lockdown, their admirers are either amazed by the view from their high-rise apartment or their vast balcony, which has its own share of vegetation.</p>
                        <p>The whitewashed walls and light-colored furniture reflect the couple’s preference for simplicity and minimalism, but the expansive view of the Mumbai cityscape and sea elevates it to the level of luxury. The couple reportedly paid Rs. 34 crore for the flat, which was erected on more than 7,000 square feet a few years ago. It is situated on the 35th storey of a residential building in Worli.</p>
                        <p>Anushka has done enough to bring her followers’ attention to the many “sunlit” regions of her residence by sharing photos of the apartment. Aside from a few art pieces on the walls, the pair, who are known to enjoy living in green spaces, has added plenty of vegetation to the area. They decorated the balcony and balcony walls with potted plants in various shades of green to keep them close to nature and add natural features to the living space, They opted to have enough of open space not just for themselves, but also for their pets. The residence also includes a private gym area where Virat and Anushka frequently exercise together.</p>

                            <img class="show-on-mobile img-fluid" src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anushka.png " alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>Anushka and Virat, who frequently spend time apart due to professional responsibilities, were sequestered in their house for more than six months during the first phase of the Mumbai lockdown. During this time, Anushka took to Instagram to describe how she likes the solitude and peace of her balcony, having a cup of coffee and cherishing the time she spends with her spouse while watching the sunrise, She posted a few photos on Instagram and commented, “And just like that, a coffee under the setting sun on our home’s balcony became a memory to cherish.” Captured by my lover.” Virat Kohli’s mansion in Mumbai is where the couple intends to raise their children.</p>
                        <p>Anushka had stated that staying at home with Virat seems like a holiday to her. She told Elle magazine in 2018, “Marriage does not feel different. Virat and I have been working around the clock. We rarely spend time together. We both lead very stressful lives. So we live in a house that we’ve scarcely spent any time in. For us, home means, “Wow!” “It is a vacation.” Their homes are furnished in such a way that any area of the house might serve as an ideal backdrop for an unexpected picture.</p>
