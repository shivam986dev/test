                    <h3>Important Vastu Tips for Home</h3>
                    <p>The homebuying process is full of opportunity. Setting up a new home after deciding on your dream
                        home allows you to create a space full of positive energy and harmony. Vastu Shastra, an ancient
                        Indian discipline, is very significant when it comes to building or designing a new home. Vastu
                        for home is based on the premise that aligning a space with cosmic principles can result in
                        wealth and pleasure. Vastu provides a comprehensive framework for organizing your home. If
                        you’ve recently purchased an under-construction home and want to design it from the ground up,

                        peaceful.</p>
                    <h3>Check out the property's shape.</h3>
                    <p>Check the shape of the space as a Vastu tip for a new home. According to Vastu, the shape of the
                        room should always be rectangular or square. These forms are seen to be auspicious, as they
                        promote the smooth flow and balance of energy. If any of the rooms are irregular in shape,
                        consider adding plants to help with energy flow.</p>
                    <h3>Verify House Entrance and Direction</h3>
                    <p>In Vastu Shastra, property orientation is essential. The directional energies that interact with
                        your home are determined by it. The main entrance of a property should ideally face north, east,
                        or northeast. These orientations are thought to bring prosperity, health, and positive energy
                        into the home and are therefore very auspicious.</p>
                    <h3>Vastu Tips for Living Room</h3>
                    <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                        <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                            src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vastu-01-300x200-1.jpg " />
                    </div>
                    <p>The living area is best oriented towards the north and east, or northeast. Don’t clutter the
                        living room. To keep things seeming light and airy, use light-colored paints like pastels,
                        whites, and creams. Happy feelings must be evoked by the color and décor. Green plants can also
                        be added to create a more upbeat atmosphere. Maintain the furnishings facing southwest or west.
                        If you plan to retain the mirror in the living room, place it on the north wall.</p>
                    <h3>Vastu Tips for Kitchen</h3>
                    <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                        <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                            src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-02-300x163-1.jpg " />
                    </div>
                    <p>The kitchen should ideally be oriented towards the southeast corner of the house. Because they
                        are auspicious and accentuate the fire element, use red, orange, or yellow for the walls. To
                        keep the kitchen clear and free of negative energy, it should have optimal ventilation. The
                        stove should be oriented towards the southeast. Remember that fire and water are two different
                        elements. Therefore, never place the water sink and gas cooker on the same platform.</p>
                    <h3>Vastu Tip for Dining Area</h3>
                    <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                        <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                            src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-03-300x210-1.jpg " />
                    </div>
                    <p>Square or rectangular dining tables are preferable to round or irregular ones, which might
                        lead to conflict in your household. Make sure there is no clutter and that the dining space
                        is well-lit. Keep the food on the dining table only. The east or southeast corner of your
                        house is a good place for the dining table; steer clear of the southwest at all costs.
                        Choose light tones for the dining area, such as cream, peach, or beige, to keep the mood
                        cheerful and upbeat.</p>
                    <h3>Vastu Tip for Bathroom</h3>
                    <p>A bathroom towards the north or northwest is the most advantageous, according to Vastu.
                        Bathrooms that face the kitchen or the main entrance should be avoided since this can
                        interfere with the flow of good vibes. The lavatory shouldn’t be in the northeast or
                        southwest corners; instead, it should face north-south. To stop bad energy from transferring
                        to other spaces, make sure the restroom doors are always kept locked. To produce a tranquil
                        impact, paint your walls with pastels or other light, soothing tones. Make sure there are no
                        leaks in the showers, faucets, or flushes. For your bathroom, go with a wooden door rather
                        than a metal one.</p>
                    <h3>Vastu Tips for Balcony</h3>
                    <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                        <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                            src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-04-300x224-1.jpg " />
                        <p>Balconies should face north or east to capture the morning sun. Waking up to the vision
                            of the rising sun is extremely good for your health. Consider adding plants such as
                            bamboo, jasmine, and tulsi to promote tranquility and prosperity. Using wooden furniture
                            on the balcony, such as swings and chairs, can boost the earth element, promoting
                            solidity and serenity. Avoid placing garbage cans or broken items on the balcony, as
                            these can draw negative energies.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Master Bedroom</h3>
                        <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                            <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                                src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-05-300x200-1.jpg " />
                        </div>
                        <p>The kids’ bedroom should face west or northwest. This promotes a child’s growth and
                            development. The bed should be set with the head facing south or east. This
                            encourages appropriate brain growth and ensures a restful sleep. Use light and
                            cheery colors, such as light greens, blues, and yellows, to raise your attitude and
                            signify achievement. It is not recommended to keep a television in the kids’ room
                            because it emits radiation and may disrupt your child’s routine. Place the study
                            table to the east or north to promote concentration.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Kids’ Bedroom</h3>
                        <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                            <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                                src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-06-300x254-1.jpg " />
                        </div>
                        <p>The child’s bedroom should face west or northwest. This promotes a child’s
                            development and growth. The head of the bed should face either east or south.
                            This guarantees restful sleep and encourages healthy brain growth. Make use of
                            bright, cheery colors that represent prosperity, such as light greens, blues,
                            and yellows. A TV should not be kept in the children’s room because it emits
                            radiation and can interfere with your child’s routine. To increase concentration
                            power, position the study table in the north or east.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Pooja Room</h3>
                        <p>Creating a Vastu-compliant pooja room or temple in your home encourages spiritual
                            growth and brings peace. The northeast corner of your home is the best placement
                            for a pooja room. If that corner is not accessible, you can opt for the north or
                            east corner. Make sure the idols are not facing each other and are positioned
                            somewhat away from the wall. Use light colours on the walls of the pooja room,
                            such as white, pale yellow, or light blue, because they are considered serene
                            and conducive to meditation. A well-lit lamp should be positioned in the
                            southeast corner of the pooja room. Open the door to the north or east if your
                            pooja room has one.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Colour & Lighting</h3>
                        <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                            <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                                src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-07-300x225-1.jpg " />
                        </div>
                        <p>According to Vastu Shastra, lighting and colour both have a significant
                            impact on the vitality and atmosphere of your home. Bright and cheery colors
                            like blue, green, or yellow, for example, improve happiness and tranquility
                            in living spaces. Conversely, to encourage relaxation and sound sleep,
                            bedrooms should use calming earth tones like beige, light brown, or soft
                            greens. Make sure that there is adequate natural light in your house during
                            the day. Choose warm, gentle artificial lighting to create a welcoming and
                            comfortable space. Steer clear of strong fluorescent lights as they can
                            disrupt the space’s equilibrium.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Windows and Doors</h3>
                        <div class="post-image-container image-fit-contain">
                            <img class="show-on-desktop img-fluid"
                                src="http://rustomjeeprojects.in/Mumbai_Homes/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Vastu-08-300x200-1.jpg " />
                        </div>
                        <p>Creating a Vastu-compliant pooja room or temple in your home encourages
                            spiritual growth and brings peace. The northeast corner of your home is
                            the best placement for a pooja room. If that corner is not accessible,
                            you can opt for the north or east corner. Make sure the idols are not
                            facing each other and are positioned somewhat away from the wall. Use
                            light colours on the walls of the pooja room, such as white, pale
                            yellow, or light blue, because they are considered serene and conducive
                            to meditation. A well-lit lamp should be positioned in the southeast
                            corner of the pooja room. Open the door to the north or east if your
                            pooja room has one.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Storeroom</h3>
                        <p>The storehouse should preferably be positioned in the southwest or
                            northwest corner of the property. To avoid stagnant energy, keep the
                            storage tidy and clutter-free. Heavy goods should be stored in the
                            southwest corner of a new home to ensure proper vastu. Ensure that the
                            storeroom door opens inwardly. This encourages the flow of positive
                            energy and success.</p>
                        <h3>Vastu Tips for Water Placement</h3>
                        <p>According to Vastu, water features such as fish aquariums or indoor water
                            fountains should be placed in the northeast or east of the home to
                            promote wealth. Such water bodies help to balance the energy in your
                            vastu home. To avoid negative consequences, keep water bodies clean and
                            well-maintained at all times. Avoid installing water elements in the
                            southeast since they can invite negative energy and financial problems.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Things to Avoid for a Vastu-Compliant Home</h3>
                        <h5>1. Do Not Store Things Under the Bed</h5>
                        <p>Keeping the area under the bed clutter-free promotes a free flow of
                            energy surrounding the bed, resulting in improved relaxation and
                            wellness.</p>
                        <h5>2. Avoid Keeping Broken Furniture</h5>
                        <p>Check that all of the furniture is in good working order. Do not keep
                            broken furniture or non-functional electrical devices at home because
                            they attract negative energy.</p>
                        <h5>3. Avoid Blocked Entrances</h5>
                        <p>Ensure that the main entry is not impeded by poles, beams, or other items
                            that prevent energy from entering the residence.</p>
                        <h5>4. Repair Those Leaky Faucets</h5>
                        <p>Water leaks from taps, flushes, or pipelines are a financial drain; thus,
                            mend and repair them as soon as possible.</p>
                        <h5>5. Do Not Use Dark Colours</h5>
                        <p>Avoid employing navy blue and black in your colour palette since they can
                            draw negative energy.</p>
                        <h3>Why Is Vastu Important in the Design of a New Home ?</h3>
                        <p>A vastu-compliant home provides a harmonious and peaceful living
                            environment. It encourages cheerfulness and the flow of good energy
                            throughout the home. Here are a few additional benefits of a complying
                            home:</p>
                        <h5>1. Improves Relationships</h5>
                        <p>Proper directions and room placements improve family relationships by
                            balancing energies in the home.</p>
                        <h5>2. Promotes Good Health & Wellbeing</h5>
                        <p>Vastu enhances physical and mental well-being by promoting positive
                            energy flow, resulting in improved health.</p>
