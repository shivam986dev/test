                    </div>
                    <p> If the home includes a glass or fake skylight panel, it might serve as an ideal framework for a
                        POP
                        false ceiling design. Choose POP edges with smooth curves or floral designs. This will make the
                        living room appear more airy and open.</p>

                    <h3>Tips to choose POP design for hall</h3>

                    <p>Go for innovative designs: Consider a combination of forms and lights rather than a basic one.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Install suitable lighting</strong>: Use energy-efficient LED lights that complement the
                        ceiling design. LED recessed lighting works exceptionally well with POP ceilings. Grand
                        chandeliers,
                        hanging lamps, cove, and flush-mount lighting are all available.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Consider bright ceiling colours</strong>: While white is the most typical choice for
                        drawing
                        room ceiling design, you can use other bright colours to make your space appear larger. For a
                        modern
                        design, add texture with a wooden, rustic, or metallic finish.</p>

                    <p><strong>Experiment with shapes</strong>: Curves, arcs, and circles are popular shapes in ceiling
                        designs. This is an excellent way to break up the symmetry and give your property a modern look.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Consider effects of colour combinations</strong>: When choosing colours for the living
                        room
                        ceiling, make sure they do not appear overbearing. A white ceiling can make a room appear larger
                        and
                        more light, but it also draws attention to the walls and furnishings. If you wish to paint the
                        walls
                        and ceilings the same colour, keep in mind that it will make your room appear smaller and more
                        relaxing.</p>

                                            False ceilings should be spaced at least 8 inches from the original ceiling

                                            False ceilings may make the room appear claustrophobic. To install fake
                                            ceilings, the room’s height must be
                                            at least 11 feet. A POP ceiling will reduce the height of your room by a few

                    <p> <strong>Cove lighting</strong>: This is a common lighting fixture for modern pop-up ceilings. 
                        Cove
                        lights are positioned in recesses or ledges in the false ceiling to offer indirect illumination
                        to
                        the room.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Pendant lights</strong>: Pendant lights can be an excellent choice for the dining room

                        features.</p>

                    <p><strong>LED strips</strong>: Flexible LED strips can be camouflaged around the ceiling’s edges,
                        coves, or grooves.</p>

                    <p><strong>Diffused lighting or backlit panels</strong>: LED panels can be put behind POP parts in
                        the
                        ceiling. This creates an ambient lighting effect.</p>

                        living
                        areas, dining rooms, and kitchens.</p>

                    <h3>How long does a POP false ceiling last?</h3>

                    <p> POP fake ceilings are typically highly durable. However, this depends on the substance utilised.
                        High-quality POP false ceilings can last for more than 20 years, however low-quality POP false
                        ceilings will develop cracks and cavities within five to six years. As a result, if you are
                        investing in a POP ceiling, ensure that your contractors utilise only high-quality POP material.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Things to know before installing a false ceiling</h3>

                    <p><strong>Planning</strong>: Try to finish the ceiling before you move into the new residence.  If
                        you
                        want to install a false ceiling in your living room, decide whether you want to cover the entire
                        surface or simply the areas surrounding the light fixtures. This will help you plan your budget
                        more
                        efficiently. Hire professionals to install POP because it can make a lot of mess.</p>

                    <p> <strong>Room Height Assessment</strong>: Some ceilings demand more height than others. So,
                        before
                        you start the installation, get the height examined. Make sure the height gap between your floor
                        and
                        ceiling allows for a false ceiling without making the room feel tight. Adequate room height is
                        required to fit the artificial ceiling seamlessly. Be prepared to add or subtract a few inches
                        in
                        height because the POP sheets require some space as well.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pre-Planning for Lighting</strong>: When remodelling your home’s interior and installing
                        a
                        false ceiling in your living room, it’s a good idea to arrange your lighting layout ahead of
                        time.
                        This proactive strategy will help you select the best fake ceiling design while preventing
                        future
                        issues. Homeowners should ensure that their ceiling is not prone to leaks. To prevent
                        unintentional
                        fires, place all electrical lines within a pipe.</p>

                    <p><strong>Selection of POP</strong>: Only use POP from reputable companies to ensure that it does
                        not
                        fracture throughout the treatment. Consider whether a specific consistency of POP is appropriate
                        for
                        the space in which it is being put. Choose a thickness of roughly 10-12 mm. Anything less would
                        be
                        susceptible to damage.  Before placing the POP, ensure that it is absolutely dry.</p>

                    <p><strong>Optimal design for small spaces</strong>: In small living rooms, choose a clean and
                        simple
                        POP ceiling design. Avoid elaborate mouldings since they might overwhelm small rooms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Creative design for large spaces</strong>: A double-layered POP artificial ceiling design
                        can bring excitement to large living areas. Experiment with different forms and textures to make
                        a
                        statement in your large living room.</p>

                    <p><strong>Border integration</strong>: If your space lacks the necessary height for a full
                        artificial
                        ceiling, try a design that runs along the wall margins. This allows you to add mood lighting
                        without
                        sacrificing vertical space.</p>

                    <p><strong>Space optimisation</strong>: POP false ceiling solutions for the living room are an ideal
                        way to disguise unsightly features like as electrical wires, air conditioning ducts, and
                        plumbing.
                        Concealing them within the artificial ceiling maximises the available area.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fan installation precaution</strong>: If you use a lightweight false ceiling material,
                        such
                        as gypsum, make sure to mount the fan on the ceiling first. This planning avoids issues
                        throughout
                        the installation process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Safety</strong>: One of the most important parts of POP ceiling installation is safety. 
                        When selecting a fake ceiling, ensure that it is supported by a h3 ceiling framework, preferably
                        one made of metal. To minimise overheating, keep the area dry and allow for airflow.</p>

                    <h3>Concluding Pop Designs</h3>

                    <p>When considering installing a POP ceiling in a hall, numerous aspects must be considered,
                        including
                        pricing, ceiling space availability, drop height, designs, installation, and labour expenses. If
                        you
                        want to add new features like lights or speakers, your overall prices may rise. Furthermore, the
                        pricing may vary depending on whether you want to install a POP ceiling in one room or
                        throughout
                        the house. POP artificial ceilings are more cheap than other false ceiling materials like wood
                        or
                        metal.</p>
